# The Science & Theory

## 1. Decision Making: The Brain as a Statistician
Based on the **Normative Decision-Making Model** (Glaze et al., 2015), we hypothesize that the brain constantly estimates the **Hazard Rate** ($H$):

$$H = \frac{P(\text{Change})}{P(\text{Stability})}$$

* **Leaky Integration:** In volatile music (Condensed), the brain discards past information rapidly.
* **Perfect Integration:** In stable music (Extended), the brain accumulates information, stabilizing perception.

## 2. Psychophysics: Redundancy & Flow
August Schick’s theory suggests that high redundancy frees up "cognitive bandwidth." We measure this using a **Continuous Visuomotor Tracking Task**.
