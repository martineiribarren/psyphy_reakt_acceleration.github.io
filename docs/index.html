# The Neurophysiology of the Mix
## Acceleration vs. Immersion

> **Status:** 🟢 Recruitment Open | 🟡 Data Collection (In Progress) | ⚪ Analysis

We are investigating what every raver knows but science has yet to quantify: the biological difference between "fast consumption" and "deep immersion." In an era of **Accelerationism**—where media is fragmented and hyper-condensed—we use psychophysics and neurophysiology to measure the cost of volatility and the biology of "Flow."

### The Core Conflict
A study by the **Sonic Research Initiative & MTDML Lab** exploring how musical structure reshapes cognitive processing and physiological states.

1. **The Condensed Set (High Volatility):** High information density. High Hazard Rate ($H$).
2. **The Extended Set (High Redundancy):** Loops, stability. Low Hazard Rate ($H$).
